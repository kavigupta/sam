Code for paper Improved modeling of RNA-binding protein motifs in an interpretable neural model of RNA splicing.

Read the paper [here](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-03162-x). Paper by Kavi Gupta, Chenxi Yang, Kayla McCue, Osbert Bastani, Phillip A Sharp, Christopher B Burge, and Armando Solar-Lezama.

For legacy reasons related to branching this code off of the SpliceAI repository, all our code is rooted in the folder `spliceai/Canonical`. See the README in this folder for information on how to run the code in this repository
